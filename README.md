Adds following commands:
- Edit/Enhancements/Duplicate line
- Edit/Enhancements/Cut selection or line
- Edit/Enhancements/Move line down
- Edit/Enhancements/Move line up

to which you probably want to assign a shortcut, and in case of `cut`, repalce the default, bacause this one functions like in other editors.

Lemme know if you want a binary.
